          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
            One of the most impactful developments has been the introduction of <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>, which significantly improved the accuracy of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. In addition, techniques like <em>transfer learning</em> and <em>data augmentation</em> have allowed deep learning models to perform exceptionally well in industry, even with smaller datasets.

            <li><span className="font-semibold">Transfer Learning</span> enables models to build on pre-trained knowledge, reducing the training time for new tasks.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Data Augmentation</span> helps increase the diversity of data, making models more robust to unseen inputs.</li>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Today, deep learning is used in a variety of sectors, including healthcare, autonomous vehicles, security, and retail analytics. For example:

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>In <strong>healthcare</strong>, deep learning models help detect diseases from medical images, providing faster diagnoses.</li>
            <li>Autonomous vehicles use <strong>computer vision</strong> to perceive their surroundings, making real-time decisions to ensure safety.</li>
            <li>Retailers utilize <strong>deep learning</strong> to analyze customer behavior, optimize product placements, and even detect theft in stores.</li>
          </ol>

        <div className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800">Technical Details: How It Works</h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
            At the heart of many of these breakthroughs lies the convolution operation. A CNN processes an image by sliding small filters (also known as kernels) over the image to detect important features, such as edges, textures, and objects. These filters learn to recognize patterns through backpropagation, optimizing the networkâ€™s ability to classify or detect objects.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            The deeper the network, the more abstract features it can learn. Early layers might detect simple shapes, while deeper layers can detect complex patterns, such as faces or cars.
